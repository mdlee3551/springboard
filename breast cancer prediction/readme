This repository includes 1) a final report (summarizes the problem, approach, final results), 2) ipython code

• data cleaning, wrangling, EDA, statistical analysis, logistic regression/support vector machine/decision tree/random forest/Gradient boosting modeling for machine learning and neural network modeling.

• Performed detailed analysis of feature selection, feature distribution and correlation with tumor malignancy, mined important features for decision-making, evaluated model performance (accuracy improved to 1).

• Analyzed dimension decomposition to improve model accuracy.

• Tools used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborns, sklearn, scipy, statsmodel, Keras.


For the analysis, I used the dataset from UCI machine learning repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).
