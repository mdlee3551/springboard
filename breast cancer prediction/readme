My goal is to be able to suggest a malignancy prediction result to patients who had exams on tumors with several features. 

To analyze this, I used data from UCI machine learning repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). 

I analyzed data in pandas, and took a few steps to clean it up, analyze and
run several machine learning models including deep learning for predictions.
